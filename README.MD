# NBA-API-TS

## Project Info:

Backend data aggregation, storage, and manipulation for basketball statistics (NBA, ABA, BAA) collected from varying authorities (e.g. [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com), [NBA Stats API](https://www.nba.com/stats/), [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/), etc.)  

Data is aggregated from these sources, looking first to [BasketBall Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com) as the authority on historical data, and then written to varying mongodb collections, which comprise the dataset used for [Baller Analytics](https://balleranalytics.ai).

- While Baller Analytics strives to provide the most accurate and complete dataset of historical hoops data, Baller Analytics makes no gaurantee as to the accuracy of the data provided
  - N.B. Migrating the codebase from javascript -> typescript should only improve accuracy of dataset 
- DB Models are constantly in flux as codebase is refactored to typescript; do not bundle with critical apps until stable release becomes available.
